# Stale data: cases that need testing

Any screen that reads data from the database can display a value that has since been changed by another user or another operation. This document lists every such case across all apps, what can change, and whether a real-time update mechanism is already in place.

The general test pattern is: open the screen, trigger the change from a second session or directly in the database, then verify the first screen either updates automatically or shows a clear indication that data has changed.

## Order status

Order status progresses through: `Draft → Sent → Confirmed → Delivered`.

| Where shown | What is displayed | Can change while viewing? | Real-time update? |
|---|---|---|---|
| Admin app — Orders page | Status badge per order | Yes | Subscription `orderStatusChanged` |
| Admin app — Orders page filter | Count of orders per status | Yes | Subscription `orderStatusChanged` |
| Nurse app — Overview page | Order count by status | Yes | Subscription `orderStatusChanged` |
| Nurse app — Overview page | Order cards | Yes | Subscriptions `orderStatusChanged`, `orderDraftCreated` |
| CLI — `orders list` | Status column | No (snapshot) | — |
| CLI — `orders send/confirm/deliver` output | Status after action | No (result of action) | — |

**Specific case that failed:** The pharmacy app showed `1 in stock ⚠︎` during delivery instead of `0 in stock ⚠︎` after a concurrent stock change. The screen had not refreshed to reflect the delivery.

## Stock level

Stock level decreases when an order is delivered and increases when a product is restocked.

| Where shown | What is displayed | Can change while viewing? | Real-time update? |
|---|---|---|---|
| Admin app — Inventory page | `stockLevel` per product | Yes | Subscription `medicinalProductUpdated` |
| Admin app — Inventory page | Below-threshold warning ⚠︎ | Yes | Subscription `medicinalProductUpdated` |
| Admin app — Inventory page | Low stock count summary | Yes | Subscription `medicinalProductUpdated` |
| Admin app — Product detail | `stockLevel`, `isBelowThreshold` | Yes | Subscription `medicinalProductUpdated` |
| Pharmacy app — Deliver order screen | Stock level shown per product selection | Yes | Not verified — **this was the failing case** |
| CLI — `medications show` | `stock: N` per product | No (snapshot) | — |
| CLI — `medications restock` output | New stock level | No (result of action) | — |

**Failure mode:** A delivery screen reads stock level when it first loads. If another delivery or restock happens before the pharmacist confirms, the displayed level is wrong. The `SufficientStock` business rule catches this at the use case level and returns `InsufficientStock`, but the screen still shows the stale value — the user sees a confusing mismatch between what is displayed and the error message they receive.

**Recommended fix:** After receiving `InsufficientStock` or `Conflict`, the delivery screen should refresh the product list before showing the error.

## Order lines

Order lines (the medications and quantities on a draft order) can be edited by the nurse before the order is sent.

| Where shown | What is displayed | Can change while viewing? | Real-time update? |
|---|---|---|---|
| Nurse app — Order detail | Line items (medication, quantity) | Yes, until sent | Subscription `orderDraftUpdated` |
| Admin app — Orders page | Medication names and line count | Yes, until sent | No subscription for line changes in admin |
| Pharmacy app — Deliver order screen | Order lines to fulfil | Yes, until confirmed | Not verified |

**Risk:** A pharmacist loads an order to deliver. The nurse edits the order (which should not be possible once sent, but worth verifying) or the system shows line data from a stale cache.

## Product name and threshold

These change rarely (admin action required) but they can change.

| Where shown | What is displayed | Can change while viewing? | Real-time update? |
|---|---|---|---|
| Admin app — Inventory page | `productName` | Rarely | Subscription `medicinalProductUpdated` |
| Admin app — Inventory page | `stockThreshold` | Rarely | Subscription `medicinalProductUpdated` |
| Pharmacy app — Deliver order screen | `productName` in product selector | Rarely | Not verified |
| CLI — `medications show` | `productName` | No (snapshot) | — |

---

## Medication reference data

`innName`, `atcCode`, `form`, `strength` are immutable once created (there is no update use case for these fields). No stale-data risk.

---

## Ward unit name

Ward unit names can be changed by an admin via `UpdateWardUnitUseCase`.

| Where shown | What is displayed | Can change while viewing? | Real-time update? |
|---|---|---|---|
| Admin app — Users page | Ward unit name alongside each nurse | Rarely | No subscription |
| Admin app — Orders page | Ward unit name per order | Rarely | No subscription |
| Nurse app — Overview page | Ward unit context | Rarely | No subscription |
| CLI — `ward-units list` | Ward unit name | No (snapshot) | — |

---

## Actor list

Actors can be created, updated, or deleted by an admin. Role and ward unit assignment can change.

| Where shown | What is displayed | Can change while viewing? | Real-time update? |
|---|---|---|---|
| Admin app — Users page | Actor list with roles and ward | Rarely | No subscription |

**Risk:** An admin changes another actor's role or ward assignment while a second admin is viewing the list. Low likelihood, low severity.

---

## Audit log

Append-only. Existing entries never change. New entries appear while viewing.

| Where shown | Real-time update? |
|---|---|
| Admin app — Audit page | No subscription — page must be refreshed manually to see new entries |

---

## Summary: highest-risk screens

| Screen | Risk | Mechanism in place? |
|---|---|---|
| Pharmacy app — Deliver order | Stock may be stale at time of delivery | No — **failing case** |
| Admin app — Inventory page | Stock level and threshold warning | Yes — `medicinalProductUpdated` subscription |
| Admin app — Orders page | Order status | Yes — `orderStatusChanged` subscription |
| Nurse app — Overview page | Order status and counts | Yes — `orderStatusChanged` subscription |
| Admin app — Users page | Actor list, roles, ward assignments | No — manual refresh required |
| Admin app — Orders page / Nurse app | Ward unit name shown alongside orders | No — manual refresh required |
| Admin app — Audit page | New audit entries | No — manual refresh required |
| CLI (all commands) | All data | No — all CLI output is a point-in-time snapshot |
